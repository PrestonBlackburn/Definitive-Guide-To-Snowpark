# Chapter 5 - Developing Data Science Projects With Snowpark

This Chapter focuses on building ML models pipelines. Data science pipelines are build built using both traditional Scikit based model building and deployed using stored procedure as well as leveraged new Snowpark ML pipeline. The chapter also covers how SnowparkML eases out the model building process by using sckit based coding paradigm
